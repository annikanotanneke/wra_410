            Shirley Temples are my fav bev.

    </ul>

    <p>
        I am proficient in HTML and CSS. I started learning these markup languages during my senior year of high school, and I enjoy making personal projects with these languages in my free time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, I am horrible at javascript. I'm still working on mastering it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, I am proficient in .vtt and .srt file types. I have been creating video captions for work for the past two years with these file types.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this class, I first want to learn more about applying javascript to my websites, because I really struggle with it. I also would like to become more skilled in web development as a whole.
