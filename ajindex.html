        <li>I have a passion for music and would love to be able to become a designer for an independent artist or production company sometime in the future.</li>

        <li>I have a black cat named Manny and his first "Gotcha day" will be October 1st of this year.</li>

    <p>My familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript has all been recent in the past year since I started in the XA program. 
    So far, I've taken WRA 210 and XA 310, both with Jeff this past fall and spring. I also have taken an Intro to Programming 
    class at my local community college but that is the only previous time I've been introduced to coding.</p>
    <p>I'd like to continue learning about different ways I can use HTML and CSS in front-end developing practices
    in WRA 410 this semester. I want to learn more to continue to develop my portfolio that I can use to apply for jobs 
    after I graduate. Eventually, I hope to grow more front-end skills that I can use in my personal and professional career.</p>
